        longDescription: `
          In this Nanodegree program, you'll learn the essential foundations of AI: the programming tools (Python, NumPy, PyTorch), the math (calculus and linear algebra), and the key techniques of neural networks (gradient descent and backpropagation).
          
          We've designed this program to prepare you for more advanced programs in AI. You'll learn Python, how to use Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and prepare you for building deep learning applications with PyTorch.
          
          This program offers a solid foundation in neural networks for intermediate programmers who already know some Python.
